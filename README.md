# Sudoku-solver

This Python code implements a Sudoku solver based on the backtracking algorithm. The solution is recursive: it attempts to place valid numbers in empty positions, backtracking when necessary. 

However, it's crucial to note that using algorithms like this can exponentially slow down the resolution process relative to the size of the Sudoku. 

The code includes functions to print the grid, find empty positions, check the validity of assignments, and solve Sudoku. The main file runs the solver on a set of example grids, measuring the execution time and displaying the solutions.

This project is valuable for understanding the implementation of backtracking algorithms and solving logic puzzles like Sudoku.
