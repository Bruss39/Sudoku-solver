# Sudoku Solver

Welcome to the Sudoku solver! This project provides an efficient way to solve Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm and a technique for assigning and removing fixed numbers.

## Key Features

- **Backtracking Resolution:** The code implements a backtracking-based resolution algorithm that seeks a valid solution for the given Sudoku.

- **Fixed Number Assignment:** An advanced technique is used to assign fixed numbers to cells, reducing the number of attempts needed for resolution.

## Usage Instructions

1. Change the value of `sudoku_number` to select one of the provided Sudoku puzzles.
2. Run the code to visualize the initial Sudoku.
3. The program will apply the fixed number assignment technique to simplify the Sudoku.
4. Next, the backtracking algorithm will be used to solve the Sudoku.
5. The final result will be printed along with the time taken for resolution.

## Puzzle Examples

The project includes various Sudoku puzzles of different difficulties. You can experiment with these by changing the value of `sudoku_number`.
